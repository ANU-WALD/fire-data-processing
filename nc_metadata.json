    "summary": "Live Fuel moisture content (LFMC), the mass of water contained within live vegetation in relation to the dry mass, is a critical variable affecting fire interactions with fuel. LFMC is one of the primary variables in many fire behavior prediction models and fire danger indices, as it affects ignition, combustion, the amount of available fuel, fire severity and spread, and smoke generation and composition (Text from Yebra, M., Chuvieco, E., Danson, M., Dennison, P., Hunt, E.R, Jurdao, S., Riano, D., Zylstra, P, 2013.  A global review of remote sensing of live fuel moisture content for fire danger assessment: moving towards operational products. Remote sensing of environment.136, 455-468.).",
